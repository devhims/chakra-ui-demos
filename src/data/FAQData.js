      question:
        'Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?',
      answer:
        'Airborne spread has not been reported for COVID-19 and it is not believed to be a major driver of transmission based on available evidence. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.',

      question: 'Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?',
